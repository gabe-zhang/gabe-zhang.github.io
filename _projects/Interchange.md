### Quick Summary

In this project, I worked with NoSQL technologies like Apache Spark, Cassandra, MongoDB, and Neo4j in a peer-to-peer e-commerce context. I used a large dataset with over 52,000 records, covering aspects like buyers, sellers, items, ratings, and advertising. I set up databases on both traditional systems and Database as a Service (DBaaS) platforms, including Databricks, DataStax Astra, and MongoDB Atlas. The main goal was to explore various database designs and their suitability for e-commerce applications.
