Hi, I am a passionate **_Data Detective_** with hands-on experience in data science team projects and applying AI to escalate business solutions. I graduated from the [MLDS](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/machine-learning-data-science) master's program at Northwestern University, focusing on analytics and AI applications (deep learning, foundation models, LLMs). During my past internship at SS&C Intralinks, I worked as a Data Science Engineer Intern, where I engineered a language-identification POC, achieving 99% top-1 accuracy at 0.15s/document latency. 

Recently, I have been following the book [Build A Large Language Model (From Scratch)](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch) to dive deeply into language models and their underlying designs. I am also learning the [TinyML and Efficient Deep Learning Computing](https://hanlab.mit.edu/courses/2024-fall-65940) course from MIT to train and deploy AI models on resource-constrained devices.

Why **_Data Detective_**? I love reading Sherlock Holmes! I admire his ability to unravel mysterious cases through the observation of subtle clues and making shrewd deductions. In the era of big data, I am dedicated to bridging business needs with analytical expertise and business acumen to unearth valuable insights from complex datasets, ultimately utilizing data to support evidence-based decisions.
